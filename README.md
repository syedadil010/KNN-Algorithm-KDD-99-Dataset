# KNN-Algorithm-KDD-99-Dataset
**K-Nearest Neighbour** algorithm for multiclass classification implemented from scratch without the direct use of algorithm library from sklearn.  
It is tailored as a network intrusion detector, a predictive model capable of distinguishing between bad connections, called intrusions or attacks, and good normal connections.

## Dataset
**KDD Cup 1999 Data**- This database contains a standard set of data to be audited, which includes a wide variety of intrusions simulated in a military network environment.
 
The algorithm was implemeted as a part of the group project - **Network Intrusion Detection System using Data Mining Techniques**.
